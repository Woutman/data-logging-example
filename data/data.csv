There is a VIP section that gets you closer to the stage with some added perks like exclusive access areas, and sometimes even a meet-and-greet opportunity. The general admission area is usually standing room only, which gives you the flexibility to move around and find a spot you like.\n\nAs for the view from the back, venues usually try to ensure that there are no obstructed views, but it can vary. If you're concerned about being behind a pillar or having a restricted view, I would recommend either the VIP section or arriving early to secure a good spot in general admission.\n\nIf you'd like, I can check the availability of the VIP tickets for you. Would you like me to do that?""}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""Oh, VIP sounds intriguing, but I have a lot to consider. Like, what if I get hungry or thirsty during the concert?

At most venues, there are usually a variety of food and drink options available, including some quick bites and beverages. The VIP section often has its own exclusive concessions, so you might have access to some premium options there. Generally, outside food and drinks aren't allowed, so I'd recommend trying what's available at the venue.\n\nRegarding parking, it's always a good idea to arrive early to secure a spot and avoid heavy traffic. Many venues offer reserved parking spots for VIP ticket holders, which can make your arrival and departure much smoother. If that’s a priority for you, opting for VIP might be worthwhile.\n\nAs for weather concerns, most concerts will go on rain or shine, but venues typically have contingency plans in place. It’s good to check the specific venue's policy on postponements or cancellations due to weather, but having a poncho handy can be a lifesaver!\n\nIf you're leaning towards VIP or have more questions, let me know, and I can assist with ticket availability or any other details!""}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""Oh wow, that's a lot to think about.

While artists often like to keep their setlists a surprise, you can sometimes find previous setlists online to get an idea of what they might play. Keep in mind, though, that these can change from show to show.\n\nAs for merchandise, there will definitely be a selection of Pendulum gear available at the concert, including t-shirts, hoodies, and more. Popular items can sell out quickly, so if there's something you really want, it's best to head to the merch stand early in the evening.\n\nRegarding ticket refunds, policies can vary depending on the vendor or the event. Typically, tickets are non-refundable, but it’s always good to check the specific terms when purchasing. Some vendors offer ticket insurance for an additional fee, which can provide peace of mind if your plans might change.\n\nIf you’re ready to make a decision or need help with anything else, just let me know!

I can definitely check on the seating comfort for specific venues once you choose one.\n\nRegarding the weather, most of the concerts are held in indoor venues, so you won't have to worry about the rain. For any outdoor events, we can look up the typical weather conditions for the time of year you're planning to attend.\n\nLet me know if you need more details or have decided on a city, and I'll be happy to assist further!""}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""I mean, I'd like to go somewhere where it's not too hot, but then again, I don't want it to be too cold either.

My ears are pretty sensitive, and I don't want to leave with a headache. Can you check all that for me?""}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""Absolutely, I can help with that! If you're aiming for a comfortable climate, venues in cities with moderate weather, like San Francisco or London during spring or fall, might be ideal for you.\n\nRegarding snacks, most venues have food and beverage stands, so you'll have access to a variety of snacks and drinks. It's a good idea to arrive a bit earlier to grab something before the show starts, that way you won’t miss any of the action.\n\nDrum & bass concerts, including Pendulum's, are known for their high energy and loud music. To protect your ears, I highly recommend bringing a pair of earplugs designed for concerts. They can reduce the volume while maintaining sound quality, ensuring you enjoy the music without discomfort.\n\nIf you have any more questions or are ready to look at ticket options, just let me know! I'm here to help you find the perfect concert experience.""}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""Okay, but do you think they play any slow songs during the concert?

Can you find out for me?""}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""Pendulum's concerts are typically high-energy with a focus on their signature drum & bass sound, but they do occasionally mix in some slower, atmospheric tracks to give the audience a breather. This can vary by setlist, so it might be a good idea to check out recent concert reviews or setlists online for an idea of what to expect.\n\nRegarding parking, most venues offer parking facilities, but availability can vary, and it often fills up quickly. I recommend checking the venue's website for parking information or considering public transport options if they're convenient for you.\n\nAs for meet-and-greet opportunities, these are sometimes available but can be limited. They might be offered as part of VIP packages. If you're interested, I can look into specific dates and venues to see if these options are available. Just let me know which city you're leaning towards, and I can provide more details.\n\nIf you have any more questions or want to explore ticket options, feel free to ask!""}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Alright, but how would I even find out about the setlists or reviews?

They often list recent setlists for concerts and offer reviews from attendees. You can also search for concert reviews on Google or check social media platforms where fans might share their experiences.\n\nFor public transport, apps like Google Maps or Citymapper are incredibly useful. They provide step-by-step directions and real-time updates for getting around in cities. You just need to enter your starting point and the venue's address, and they’ll guide you on which buses or trains to take.\n\nRegarding cameras, most venues have restrictions on professional cameras with detachable lenses, but small personal cameras and smartphones are generally allowed for personal photos. It's always best to check the venue's camera policy ahead of time to avoid any issues.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further assistance with ticketing, just let me know!

I recommend checking with the venue's customer service closer to the event date or keeping an eye on their official communications for any upgrades or additional packages that might be released.\n\nRegarding promo codes, since you don't use social media much, you might consider signing up for venue or promoter newsletters via email. These often include exclusive deals and promo codes. Additionally, you can occasionally find promo codes through online forums or deal websites that share ticket discounts.\n\nIf you're more comfortable purchasing tickets in person, many venues have box offices where you can buy tickets directly. This can help you avoid online fees and provide peace of mind about your purchase. It’s worth calling the venue to confirm their box office hours and availability.\n\nIf you have any more questions or would like assistance with anything else, please feel free to reach out.
